### UI Audit Results (from #88, completed in #94)

A comprehensive audit was performed on the browser extension UI. Key findings, as detailed in [PR #94](https://github.com/Jin-HoMLee/shuttle-insights/pull/94), include:

#### Design System Analysis
- The extension currently uses a custom CSS design system, with no Material Design components or external UI frameworks.
- Material Design-inspired colors are implemented via CSS custom properties.
- Modern design tokens provide consistent theming across all components.
- No external dependencies, ensuring performance and maintainability.

#### UI Architecture & Components
- Single-page application with a main draggable/resizable overlay panel.
- 8 functional sections, 20+ distinct UI components (buttons, controls, info displays, etc).
- Modular and well-organized code structure.

#### Accessibility & Technical Highlights
- Full ARIA label support, semantic HTML, and comprehensive keyboard navigation.
- Responsive design with mobile optimization.
- Modern CSS (custom properties, flexbox, transitions).
- All 61 tests pass across 7 test suites.

#### Documentation
- See `UI_AUDIT.md` and `UI_COMPONENT_DIAGRAM.md` for detailed component inventory, design system analysis, and diagrams.

#### Next Steps (for this issue)
- Use the audit as a reference to systematically replace custom UI with Material Design 3 (Material You) components according to Material 3 guidelines.
- Prioritize high-traffic and interactive components for migration.
- Ensure new implementation maintains accessibility and performance standards.
